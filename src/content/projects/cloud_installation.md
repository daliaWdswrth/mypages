## About This Project

This installation is a cumulation of a semester's work focusing on interactivity and embodied cognition. It aims to explore how physical movement and spatial awareness can translate into dynamic visual experiences, creating a dialogue between the human body and computational systems through particle manipulation.

It utilizes a Lidar sensor for hand-tracking which then displaces particles in real-time, creating movements that mirror the user's gestures.
