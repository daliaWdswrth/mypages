*Stationary Dash* is a 2D platformer game where the user plays as a stick-figure drawn in a kid's notebook and aims to collect a gold star sticker at each level. There are 11 levels in total, each presenting its own unique challenge. The player can place down ground stickers to step/jump onto but the given number of these stickers varies between levels.

For this project, I worked in a team of 4 as a:
- Programmer
- Level Designer
- Artist
- Animator
