## Overview

These projects explore how people can directly manipulate digital visuals. My interactive poster uses mouse tracking to reveal hidden layers of animated noise. The weather particle system connects real-world data to graphicsâ€”users press keys to change particle mass, birth rates, and wave patterns based on live temperature and wind data in TouchDesigner. I've also conceptualized a light installation using particle clouds that would respond to physical presence. Each project asks the same basic question: how can our input reshape what we see on screen, turning static displays into something responsive.
