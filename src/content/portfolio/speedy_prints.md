This series of reliefs is the outcome of careful observations of light and color through the foliage of local gardens near my home. Using imagery of native plant and flower species in the area, I experimented with color and layered textures to emulate the experience of being surrounded by nature, not just visually but also in a tactile and atmospheric senseâ€”the shifting density of leaves, the play of shadow, and the feeling of immersion that goes beyond sight.
