This is a series of relief prints carved from a linoleum block and printed on pastel-colored, handmade paper. The image of a person looking through the flowers and foliage is meant to suggest the act of searchingâ€”an attempt to see more clearly while being partially obscured by the natural world. As with most of my other printmaking projects, this one also explores the impact of color and layering, specifically by using overlapping tones and transparent inks to create depth and atmosphere.
