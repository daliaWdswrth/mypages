This project aims to research and record the various ways in which different people choose to map out a journey—or multiple journeys—they’ve undertaken in their lives. The book relies on user participation to construct a map that ties these different journeys together through drawings, printed photos, found objects, collage, etc. Participants will not only be able to add/create maps of their own, but also interact with those shared by others before them. The intent is to see where our paths intersect and diverge, prompting us to observe and reconsider what defines a map and what defines a journey.

The book itself is riso-printed and hand-bound, the physical version also has blank pages attached to the end for further exploration. Please [contact me](mailto:dalia.wadsworth@tufts.edu) for a viewing of the whole book.
