This is a short zine detailing some of the differences between butterflies and moths. Each page unfolds like a field guide to everyday wonders, celebrating not just the differences between these creatures, but the practice of paying attention to the world that surrounds us daily.

## The Process

Here's a look into the printing process:

After drawing each full spread in Procreate, I separated the layers by color and laid them out in Photoshop. Then, when screenprinting, I started with the blue layer,

Then did the red. The colors came out better than expected and looked great together!

Finally, I cut and assembled the zines. I was able to make many of them due to the chosen size and medium.
