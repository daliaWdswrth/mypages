This is a short zine inviting the reader to get curious and notice the world of much smaller creatures living all around them. It features the works of a few poets (Madison Casein, Sir Charles George Douglas Roberts, and Annette Wynne) who found wonder in the tiniest details of the natural world, capturing the lives of insects with curiosity, tenderness, and a sense of play.

Similar process followed for creating these zines as in [this zine about butterlies and moths](/portfolio/butterfly_book).
