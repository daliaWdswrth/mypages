A collection of insect forms pieced together from my own photos and memories. Each bug is built from fragments of personal momentsâ€”snippets of family photos, close-ups of textures, bits of color and light that once meant something specific but now become part of something new. The process feels like metamorphosis itself: taking these documented pieces of my past and transforming them into living creatures.

These images are also featured in another project: [Screenprint Quilt](/portfolio/quilt_print).
