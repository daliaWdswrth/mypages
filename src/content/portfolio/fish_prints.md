There’s a pond with koi and goldfish that I visit often, and this pronto-plate print grew out of those observations. It reflects my fascination with the way water catches and layers light, while also serving as an early experiment in layering multiple colors through printmaking. It’s the very first print I ever made, and it holds that sense of discovery for me.
