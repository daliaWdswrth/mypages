A group anthology of personal objects and collections in a riso-printed, handmade book. Five artists, including myself, each designed a signature of eight pages filled with objects that are meaningful to us. All of the objects are small in size but still carry the weight of memory, attachment, and personal history. Together, the signatures form a collective archive where the intimate scale of the objects contrasts with the breadth of the stories they hold. The risographâ€™s soft textures and layered colors lend a sense of warmth and imperfection, echoing the way our relationships to objects are shaped by use, time, and care.
